                    <p>
                        The controls will be very simple. They will have a gun the swivels from the middle botton of the
                        screen that points at their mouse and shoots when they click. Potentially instead of that, there
                        it
                        won't swivel and instead will always be pointing up but will match the X position of their
                        mouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic challange will be a simple galega style arcade shooter of making sure they destroy all
                        the
                        cats. They can't just shoot wildly though because if they hit a dog then they loose (or maybe
                        there
                        is a life system, in which case I would maybe include health packs). Its a simple game of aim,
                        reflexes, and restraint. The enemy spawn will increase over time and the player's goal will be
                        to
                        get a high score. I will record the high score using local storage.

                    <p>
                        To teach them I will maybe have text appear when the game starts or maybe
                        just in the starting screen that says something along the lines of "Shoot down the cats but
                        don't
                        hit a dog!".

                    <p>
                        My name is Teddy Walsh and I am a Game Design and Development Major at RIT. Graduating class of
                        2024. I love writing stories and running D&D. More info right

            <div class="project">
                <div class="description">
                    <h3>
                        Proscess
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I started out with the Circle Blast exercise as the basic framework for getting things to move
                        and load properly. I then started to deviate heavily from that to make my own vision a
                        reality.<br><br>

                        The first step was getting the gun to work. I had to do some weird math to make sure it was
                        always pointing in the right direction. I then also had to mess around with the bullets. It took
                        me an emberrasingly long time to figure out that the "x" and "y" in the comstructor are where to
                        render it relative to the center, not the actual X and Y coordinates of the object... I
                        eventually figured that out though and then bullets shot from the end of the gun!<br><br>

                        I then made the animals work. My original plan was to have different classes for cats and dogs,
                        but I realized that they reused much of the code and the only things that changed were their
                        sprites and the interactions when they got shot or reached the bottom of the screen, so instead,
                        I made 1 "Animal" class and gave them bool values for if it is a cat or not and if it is an
                        enemy or not. Being a cat (or dog) determined the sprite that gets loaded, and being an enemy
                        determines its interactions. This way I could pretty easily change which animals were the
                        enemies (which was a requested feature by multiple people).<br><br>

                        I also added a feature where the game is able to detect and display the highscore of the user
                        and its saved to local storage, so it persists when the user leaves the page.<br><br>

                        That took most of the time. I also did some cleanup, such as adding a font, adding a favicon,
                        adding sound effects, and adding an end screen.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Things To Look For
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I am proud of loading in and saving the highscore from local storage, that is a good feature. It
                        makes it feel more game-y and adds far more replayability since now you have a more clear
                        goal.<br><br>

                        Making the gun pivot from the center and follow the mouse as well as making the bullets spawn at
                        the end of the gun was difficult to impliment but came out well.<br><br>

                        Making the cats and dogs switchable did require that I change my entire plan, which was
                        difficult but turned out well enough. Now there is a button on the start and end screen with
                        updating text that shows which is the enemy. That was a highly requested feature that makes the
                        game much more fun.<br><br>

                        I did also make a way to randomly choose which sprite to use, adding some variety and humor to
                        the game. Its a modular system so if I ever want to have more then I can easily add them in and
                        change the "numOfSprites" constant. They've also all been compressed to not be too large of
                        files.<br><br>

                        I added a font but I think PIXI is finicky about loading it for the first time. I tried to use
                        the fontFaceObserver library to load in the fonts before but the documentation made no sense to
                        me.
